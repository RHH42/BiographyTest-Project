      <div class="bio-10text">
        Spurgeon's father died when he was 4 years old.  His mother placed him, his brothers James Alfred and John Henry Hutchins in the Baptist orphanage (later called the Baptist Children's Home) at Thomasville, North Carolina where they received primary and secondary schooling.  Spurgeon matriculated at Mars Hill College in 1910 where he remained for 2 terms before leaving at the age of 16.
      
        Spurgeon became a printer, starting when movable type was still in use and later becoming a Mergenthaler Lin-O-Type machine operator. He worked at different times for Edwards & Broughton Printing Co., The News & Observer, and Bynum Printing Co. where he set type for NC Courts proceedings. He was a member of the International Typographical Union for more than 40 years before retiring in 1959.
